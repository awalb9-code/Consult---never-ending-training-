# Consult---never-ending-training-
Analysis of employment training from manager/employee prospective along with any other facts training or the lack of cause on any job scenario. 
# Stuck in Never-Ending Training

## The Pattern
Training never ends, but competence never arrives.
Employees are constantly “onboarding” while output expectations increase.

## What This Looks Like in Practice
- No dedicated time to learn
- Training during peak hours
- Inconsistent standards between managers

## Why It Fails
Training is treated as a checkbox, not an investment.
Managers are evaluated on coverage, not comprehension.

## Supporting Evidence (Living Section)
> This section will expand over time.

- Industry turnover data
- Internal policy contradictions
- Cognitive load research
